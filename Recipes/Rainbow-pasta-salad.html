    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Colorful dishes are so much more appetizing. Don't you think so?  I'm hoping your kids share the same thoughts. If you're shaking your head saying my kids won't ever eat a bell pepper, you won't ever know until you try. It's all about exposure, continuous exposure. Both my boys including yours truly despise raw tomatoes. I can eat it cooked, in sauce or any other way but ask me to eat it on a burger or a salad, and I'll turn away. My oldest after 4 years of offering, finally loves them! So my blanket statement is keep trying. Yes, it's frustrating but worth it in my opinion. This Rainbow Pasta Salad may get picked from, but the combination of flavors is so good.

    <p>Sometimes combining colorful foods and calling it something fun like rainbow pasta for instance, makes it more appetizing. This rainbow pasta salad recipe is fresh and flavorful. Best of all it's super easy.You can place a piece of pasta and a small bell pepper on a fork and give your child the fork.</p>
    <p>This is also perfect for summer barbecues especially potlucks. I'm always scrambling to come up with something easy that holds up the night before. I always bring the same thing, and though everyone loves my other pasta salads or desserts, something new is always nice. It feeds man and is relatively inexpensive.</p>
